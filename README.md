<!--- Readme for A bash script --->
# OHMAN

A bash script that scrapes man.archlinux.org and displays man pages. 

Ordinary man pages can only be accessed if you have that software installed. The script helps you to read the man pages of the program even before you run it. 

# To-Do 

- add feature to see if man pages are available offline and to rely on the internet version only when necessary. 
- rewrite it in rust / C or any other language so that it can be added to package repository. 

# Prerequisite 

1. wget
2. links
